Crystals

A random target number will be set.
A random value will be assigned to each of the four crystals.
Click each crystal to increase the total score by its value.
If the total score equals the target number, you win.
If the total score goes over the target number, you lose.
A new random target number and new values or the crystals will be set after each game.
